            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Design OF FIR Filters using Windows</h2>
    <p>The procedure for designing FIR filter using windows is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose the desired frequency response of the filter Hd(ω).
        </li>
        <li>Take inverse Fourier transform of Hd(ω ) to obtain the desired impulse response
            hd(n).</li>
        <li>
            Choose a window sequence w(n) and multiply hd(n) by w(n) to convert the infinite 
            duration impulse response to a finite duration impulse response h(n).
        </li>
        <li>The transfer function H(z) of the filter is obtained by taking Z-transform of h(n).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Rectangular Window</h2>
    <p>The weighting function (window function) for an N-point rectangular window is given by,</p>
    <p><img src="assets/IMG_20220716_113813.JPG"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we design a low-pass filter using rectangular window, we find that the frequency 
        response differs from the desired frequency response in many ways. It does not follow quick 
        transitions in the desired response. The desired response of a low-pass filter changes abruptly 
        from pass band to stop band, but the actual frequency response changes slowly. This region 
        of gradual change is called filter’s transition region, which is due to the convolution of the 
        desired response with the window response’s main lobe. The width of the transition region 
        depends on the width of the main lobe. As the filter length N increases, the main lobe 
        becomes narrower decreasing the width of the transition region</p>
    <h2>Triangular or Bartlett Window</h2>
    <p>The triangular window has been chosen such that it has tapered sequences from the middle 
        on either side. The window function wT (n) is defined as,</p>
    <p><img src="assets/IMG_20220716_113932.JPG" width="50%"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In magnitude response of triangular window, the side lobe level is smaller than that of 
        the rectangular window being reduced from –13 dB to –25 dB. However, the main lobe 
        width is now 8 /N or twice that of the rectangular window.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triangular window produces a smooth magnitude response in both pass band and 
        stop band, but it has the following disadvantages when compared to magnitude response obtained by using rectangular window:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The transition region is more.
        </li>
        <li>The attenuation in stop band is less</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because of these characteristics, the triangular window is not usually a good choice</p>
    <h3>Raised Cosine Window</h3>
    <p>The raised cosine window multiplies the central Fourier coefficients by approximately unity 
        and smoothly truncates the Fourier coefficients toward the ends of the filter. The smoother 
        ends and broader middle section produces less distortion of hd(n) around n = 0. It is also 
        called generalized Hamming window.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window sequence is of the form:</p>
    <p><img src="assets/IMG_20220716_113944.JPG" width="55%"></p>
    <h3>Hanning window</h3>
    <p>The Hanning window function is given by
    </p>
    <p><img src="assets/IMG_20220716_114725.JPG" width="50%"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width of main lobe is 8 /N, i.e., twice that of rectangular window which results in 
        doubling of the transition region of the filter. The peak of the first side lobe is –32 dB 
        relative to the maximum value. This results in smaller ripples in both pass band and stop 
        band of the low-pass filter designed using Hanning window. The minimum stop band 
        attenuation of the filter is 44 dB. At higher frequencies the stop band attenuation is even 
        greater. When compared to triangular window, the main lobe width is same, but the 
        magnitude of the side lobe is reduced, hence the Hanning window is preferable to triangular 
        window.</p>
    <h3>Hamming window</h3>
    <p>The Hamming window function is given by</p>
    <p><img src="assets/IMG_20220716_114738.JPG" width="50%"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magnitude response for N = 31, the magnitude of the first side lobe is down about 41dB 
        from the main lobe peak, an improvement of 10 dB relative to the Hanning window. But this 
        improvement is achieved at the expense of the side lobe magnitudes at higher frequencies, 
        which are almost constant with frequency. The width of the main lobe is 8 /N. In the magnitude 
        response of low-pass filter designed using Hamming window, the first side lobe peak is –51 dB, 
        which is –7 dB lesser with respect to the Hanning window filter. However, at higher 
        frequencies, the stop band attenuation is low when compared to that of Hanning window. 
        Because the Hamming window generates lesser oscillations in the side lobes than the Hanning 
        window for the same main lobe width, the Hamming window is generally preferred.</p>
    <h3>Blackmann window</h3>
    <p>The Blackman window function is another type of cosine window and given by the equation,</p>
    <p><img src="assets/IMG_20220716_115139.JPG" width="50%"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magnitude response, the width of the main lobe is 12π /N, which is highest among 
        windows. The peak of the first side lobe is at –58 dB and the side lobe magnitude decreases with
        frequency. This desirable feature is achieved at the expense of increased main lobe width. 
        However, the main lobe width can be reduced by increasing the value of N. The side lobe
        attenuation of a low-pass filter using Blackman window is –78 dB.
