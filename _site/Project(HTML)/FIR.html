    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> FIR Filters</h1>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A filter is a frequency selective system. Digital filters are classified as finite duration unit 
            impulse response (FIR) filters or infinite duration unit impulse response (IIR) filters, 
            depending on the form of the unit impulse response of the system. In the FIR system, the 
            impulse response sequence is of finite duration, i.e., it has a finite number of non-zero terms. 
            The IIR system has an infinite number of non-zero terms, i.e., its impulse response sequence is 
            of infinite duration. IIR filters are usually implemented using recursive structures (feedbackpoles and zeros) and FIR filters are usually implemented using non-recursive structures (no 
            feedback-only zeros). The response of the FIR filter depends only on the present and past input 
            samples, whereas for the IIR filter, the present response is a function of the present and past
            values of the excitation as well as past values of the response.

        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantages of FIR filter over IIR filters:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>FIR filters are always stable</li>
            <li>FIR filters with exactly linear phase can easily be designed.</li>
            <li>FIR filters can be realized in both recursive and non-recursive structures.</li>
            <li>FIR filters are free of limit cycle oscillations, when implemented on a finite word 
                length digital system</li>
            <li>Excellent design methods are available for various kinds of FIR filters.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disadvantages of FIR filters:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>The implementation of narrow transition band FIR filters is very costly, as it requires 
                considerably more arithmetic operations and hardware components such as multipliers,
                adders and delay elements.</li>
            <li>Memory requirement and execution time are very high.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIR filters are employed in filtering problems where linear phase characteristics within the 
            pass band of the filter are required. If this is not required, either an FIR or an IIR filter may be 
            employed. An IIR filter has lesser number of side lobes in the stop band than an FIR filter 
            with the same number of parameters. For this reason if some phase distortion is tolerable, 
            an IIR filter is preferable. Also, the implementation of an IIR filter involves fewer 
            parameters, less memory requirements and lower computational complexity</p>
        <h3>Design techniques of FIR Filters</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well known methods of designing FIR filters are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fourier series method</li>
            <li>Window method</li>
            <li>Frequency sampling method</li>
            <li>Optimum filter design</li>
        </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fourier series method, the desired frequency response Hd(n)
         is converted to a Fourier series representation by replacing n by 2*pi*fT, where T
          is the sampling time. Then using this expression, the Fourier coefficients are 
          evaluated by taking inverse Fourier transform of Hd(n), which is the desired imp
          ulse response of the filter hd(n). The Z-transform of hd(n) gives Hd(z) which is
           the transfer function of the desired filter. The Hd(z) obtained from Hd(n) will b
           e a transfer function of unrealizable non causal digital filter of infinite dura
           tion. A finite duration impulse response h(n) can be obtained by truncatin
           g the infinite duration impulse response hd(n) to N-samples. Now, take Z-transform of
            h(n) to get H(z). This H(z) corresponds to a non-causal filter. So multiply this H(z) by
             z–(N–1)/2 to get the transfer function of realizable causal filter of finite duration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In window method, we begin with the desired frequency response specification 
        Hd(n) and determine the corresponding unit sample response hd(n). The hd(n) is given
         by the inverse Fourier transform of Hd(n). The unit sample response hd(n) will be an inf
         inite sequence and must be truncated at some point, say, at n = N – 1 to yield an FIR 
         filter of length N. The truncation is achieved by multiplying hd(n) by a window seq
         uence w(n). The resultant sequence will be of length N and can be denoted by h(n). The 
         Z-transform of h(n) will give the filter transfer function H(z). There have been many wi
         ndows proposed like Rectangular window, Triangular window, Hanning window, Hamming wind
         ow, Blackman wndow and Kaiser window that approximate the desired characteristics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In optimum filter design method, the weighted approximation error between the desired frequenc
        y response and the actual frequency response is spread evenly across the pass band and ev
        enly across the stop band of the filter. This results in the reduction of maximum error.
        The resulting filter have ripples in both the pass band and the stop band. This co
        ncept of design is called optimum equiripple design criterion.</p>
    <p>The various steps involved in designing FIR filters are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose an ideal(desired) frequency response, Hd(n).</li>
        <li>Take inverse Fourier transform of Hd(n)) to get hd (n) or sample Hd(n) at finite
            number of points (N-points) to get H(k) </li> 
        <li>If hd(n) is determined, then convert the infinite duration hd(n) to a finite duration
            h(n) (usually h(n) is an N-point sequence) or if H(k) is determined, then take
            N-point inverse DFT to get h(n).</li> 
        <li>Take Z-transform of h(n) to get H(z), where H(z) is the transfer function of the
            digital filter.</li>
        <li> Choose a suitable structure and realize the filter.</li>
    </ol>
